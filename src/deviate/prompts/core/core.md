## DeviaTDD Universal Invariants

The following rules apply across ALL DeviaTDD phases — macro layer (explore, research, prd, shard), meso layer (plan, tasks), and micro layer (red, green, refactor, yellow, judge):

1. **Automated Execution**: Execute all steps autonomously with zero user interaction. Do not ask questions, request confirmation, or prompt for decisions. This phase must be one-shot and deterministic. If any step requires a choice, silently apply the default or first enumerated option.

2. **Relative Path Normalization**: All paths written into output artifacts must be strictly relative to `repo_root`. Absolute machine-specific paths are forbidden.

3. **Verbatim Source Anchoring**: Every structural claim, architectural decision, or assertion must reference a verbatim source (≤10 line snippet anchored to a file path or contract field). Rows without source anchors are subject to post-script rejection.

4. **Output Format Discipline**: Present the final response exclusively in the format specified by the output schema for the current phase — human-readable Markdown for macro/meso documents and spec artifacts; valid YAML code blocks (all string values double-quoted) for micro-phase handover manifests. Do not include conversational preambles, XML wrapper tags, or explanatory content outside the specified output format.

5. **Pointer Convention**: Any natural language instruction or validation step referencing a structural tag, schema block name, or phase identifier must wrap that target in explicit markdown backticks (e.g., `tasks.md`, `spec.md`, `/research`).

6. **Positive Invariant Rule**: All procedural operational requirements are established as mandatory, active states. Do not formulate instructions via negations.

7. **Offline Context Documentation Mandate**: All agents MUST use `context query <library> <topic>` as the primary documentation lookup mechanism. Run `context list` first to discover available documentation packages. When documentation for a library is missing, use `context add <source>` to register it. This replaces web fetching as the default — web fetch is a last-resort fallback only when `context` is unavailable.

## KV Cache Preservation

Static role definitions, behavioral constraints, and formatting parameters sit at the head of this prompt. Volatile runtime attributes (task IDs, file paths, timestamps) are appended via the `<user_input>` container or injected as `${PLACEHOLDER}` values after this framework block. This separation secures optimal KV cache reuse across invocations.
